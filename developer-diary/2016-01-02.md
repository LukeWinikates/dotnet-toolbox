After some reading today, I learned that the docker host for windows server 2016 runs windows containers on a windows host, so that'll be interesting for running windows images on CF since they'll be able to containerize the apps. For this project, it won't matter much since the goal is to use the cross-platform dnx runtime.

Some misgivings as I wonder about:

 - using Jade to make dealing with the html scaffolding more managable and leverage the node asset pipeline. React components could be rendered server-side if that felt like the thing to do, but will attaching that to a static html file be awkward?
 - using bower and pivotal-ui, which is meant to be installed as an npm module. Standing on another Pivotal team's shoulders seems reasonable, but how helpful will it really be?

I spent some time today reading about how google manages crawling javascript-heavy pages, and I'm interested in trying an experiment with client-side rendering before focusing on server-side rendering. I'm also ok with not using Pivotal UI, but will keep trying it for now.
