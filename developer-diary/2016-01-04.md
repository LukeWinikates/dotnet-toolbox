Today's morning plan is to do some basic layout scaffolding for the landing page. I don't really want to write raw html, so I'm going to do the layout in Jade. I kind of think that this'll be a bad idea overall even though it'll make me happy when I edit the layout, but I'm kind of ok with it. I can always compile the jade and turn it into regular html at a certain point.

Overall, using Pivotal UI seems to be a win so far. There's a little bit of pain on the horizon since some components want to `@include` the vendored version of `bootstrap-sass`, and I don't have a good solution to that problem. I'm a little surprised at the number of chores I've already generated, and tomorrow feels like it will be a good time to circle back and deal with some of those.

Logged issues to the LicenseFinder repo and to the travis-ci team. Having some trouble getting license_finder to work on travis, so it looks like finishing off that chore may have to wait until tomorrow.
