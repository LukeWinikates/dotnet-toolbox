## 9:20
Spent a little bit of time looking at Pivotal UI again this morning, but now I'm thinking I'll turn my attention back to Travis CI.

## 9:49
Working on getting tests to run from VS Code, trying to find the documentation page about xUnit asserts.

## 10:21
Tests run from VS Code, and the travis build is passing. I'm looking at configuring travis to push to PEZ, which has a one-time use code to log users in, so I'll need to figure out a way to get that working on travis.

## 11:04
Currently puzzling over what to do about the CF login for pez. In principle I could use travis' file encryption, check the encrypted file in, and push that way.

## 5:56
Managed to get travis pushing to CF, and now I'm deciphering the gulp asset pipelines from a few other projects to decide how building the ui assets, espescially es6->es5 compilation, should work here.
